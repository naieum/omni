# Omni

**The last stop for all media. Own your content forever.**

Omni is an open-source media platform where users truly own their library. Access TV shows, movies, books, magazines, newspapers, and music on-demand, while empowering independent artists to share their work directly with audiences.

## Core Philosophy

- **User Ownership First** - Your media library is yours forever. No corporate gatekeeping.
- **Open & Transparent** - All code is open source. No patents, no hidden agendas.
- **Universal Access** - Available to everyone, everywhere, always.
- **Artist Empowerment** - 100% royalties to independent creators. No middlemen.
